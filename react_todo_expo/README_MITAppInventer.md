# MIT App Inventor

I was googling for "open source kids learning to code courses", and there was a huge list, and through reading the headings, there was this article from Medium called "The Ultimate List of Resources to Teach Kids to Code".  I opened it and there was a list of the ones I picked up already, like Scratch, Code.org (maybe for Mikaela), Tynker, etc.  And this "MIT App Inventor" caught my eyes with a simple sentence...

```
This project is drag-and-drop programming for app development. Itâ€™s also open source.
```

I tried it, and Aiden must love this.

Basically, it's scratch, but soup up to create a phone app.  Wow! This should impress Aiden.

## First App

I browsed around the website and got into their Hour of Code, and there were a bunch of tutorials, and I thought the most basic one is the one called Hello Codi (may be a Hello Program).  So I picked it, and I quickly go through the tutorial, no block programming, just a couple of components dragged into it.

It required a bit of a setup, but it was so easy.

In 10 minutes, I have an Android Phone App running on my phone.  I spent many hours trying to set up similar things for React Native project, and just finally got it.  This took less than 10 minutes.

## Setup

* Install MIT AI2 Companion on the phone.
* 3 ways to try it... emulator, USB, or wifi.  I chose **wifi** and **QRCode**.
* After setting up the app as instructed by the tutorial, Build > App (provide QR code for .apk) to generate a QRCode.
* Run MIT AI2 Companion and scan the QRCode.
* After allowing all kinds of security breaches, the app runs perfectly.
